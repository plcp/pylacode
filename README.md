# witness

Knowledge abstraction layer, provides automation for:
 - Knowledge extraction
 - Evidence aggregation
 - Semantic examination
(â€¦and more)

# Quick setup

Please note `numpy` is required as dependency :
```sh
pip install numpy
git clone https://github.com/plcp/witness
cd witness
python -i -c "import witness as wit"
```
We support **python2.7** and **python3.6** (other versions left untested).

# TL;DR

We handle information as clusters of [beta-binomial
distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-binomial_distribution)
 and borrow some abstractions to
[subjective logics](https://scholar.google.fr/scholar?q=subjective+logic).

Then, we provide several interfaces to ease clear usage of these
abstractions and to automate our typical work flow:
 1. **Extract** knowledge from a stream of raw data.
 2. **Aggregate** the gathered evidences within a knowledge base.
 3. **Query** the knowledge base for pieces of useful insights.

We support a tag-based semantic abstraction to enable an intuitive use of the
API by the end-user while remaining open to more subtle approaches.
Thus, being able to write readable code such as:

```python
>>> knowledge_base = wit.oracle.oracle(wit.backends.naive)
>>> knowledge_base.add_labels(weather_labels)
>>> knowledge_base.submit('!warm')
>>> knowledge_base.query('cold')
['cold']
>>> knowledge_base.submit('thunder')
>>> knowledge_base.query('thunderstorm')
['cloudly', 'thunder', 'cold']
>>> knowledge_base.submit(['rainy', 'windy'])
>>> knowledge_base.query('thunderstorm')
['thunderstorm', 'rainy', 'windy', 'cloudly', 'thunder', 'cold', 'wet']
```

We also support various opinion-related abstractions to provide easy means to
weight and discount information based on reputation or apriori. Further work is
needed to provide more components for a seamless "plug and play" experience.

# Development status

Active, Work in progress.

**API still subject to frequent backward-incompatible revisions.**
